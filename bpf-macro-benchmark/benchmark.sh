# set this variable to a script that attaches any bpf program you need
# make sure the programs are pinned to the directory /sys/fs/bpf
# example script included in directory, called link.c

# times to run tests

# set this variable to the executable you want to test
# NOTE: executable should output its results to stdout
# shifts over the arguments so that all the executable options can be included
